        | id  | type    | bits | default | range              | e.g.             |
        | --- | ------- | ---- | ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |

6. Controls
    1.  loop
        1. `for (init; condition; iteration)`
        2. `for (type item: collection)`: since Java5, `item` is **read-only**, an assignment to the `item` haves no effect on the underlying object

8. Class
    1. members
        1. object: belong to instance
            1. variable: fields, instance variables
            2. method
                1. components
                    1. signature
                        1. function name
                        2. parameter: method variable receives the argument, acts like local variable scoped to its method
                            1. vararg
                                1. vararg will be array passed in, `int sum(int... v) {}`
                                2. vararg must be the last in the parameter list
                                3. only one vararg parameter allowed
                    2. arguments: values passed to a method parameters
                    3. return type
                        1. `void`: no value returned
                        2. `return`
                2. overload
                    1. same function name with different parameter declarations
                    2. return types can differ
                3. recursionz: a method calls itself
            3. constructor:
                1. have no explicit return type
                2. java provides a default constructor that initializes all member variables to their default values
                    1. `0` for numeric types
                    2. `false` for booleans
                    3. `null` for reference types
                3. if explicitly defined, the default constructor is no longer used
                4. constructor can be overloaded
            4. object related
                1. `new`
                2. `this`
        2. static: belong to class
            1. variable
            2. method
            3. static block
                1. executed when the first is first loaded, before the class can be used for any other purpose
        3. nested class: since JDK1.1
            1. static
                1. can only access static members of its outer class
                2. can be declared `private`, `public`, `protected` and package-private with no modifier
            2. non-static: inner class
                1. associate with an instance of its enclosing class
                2. access to all of the variables and methods of its outer class, similar to other non-static members of outer class, use `OuterClass.this.members`
                3. cannot define any static members itself
        4. anonymous class
            1. like a local class except do not have a name
            2. make code more concise if only use only once
            3. is an expression, enable to declare and instantiate a class at the same time
            4. cannot declare constructors
        5. abstract class and method
            1. abstract class: `abstract class name {}`
                1. when a subclass inherits an abstract class, it must implement all of its abstract methods in the superclass, otherwise, the subclass must also be specified as `abstract`
                2. abstract class can not be instanced
            2. abstract method: `abstract type name(...);`
                1. no method body is present
                2. only on instance methods, not applied to `static` methods or constructors
                3. a class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared as abstract
    2.  access modifiers
        1. top level
            1. `public`
            2. no explicit modifier: package private
        2. member level
            1. `public`: anywhere
            2. no explicit modifier: within package, can not be accessed outside the package
            3. `private`: within class
            4. `protected`: within package or subclasses inherit the class in another package
        3. others
            1. `final`
                1. final class: can not be inherited, implicitly declares all of its methods as `final`, `final class A {}`, SO `final` can not work with `abstract`
                2. final method: can not be overrided, `final void mesh() {}`
                3. final variable: create a constant value
                    1. instance
                        1. initialized when declaration, `final int a = 10;`
                        2. initialized in instance-initializer block (IIB), `final int b; { b = 20}`
                        3. inside constructors, when more than one constructor exists, must be assigned in all of constructors, `class A {final int c; A() { c = 30}}`
                    2. static
                        1. initialized when declaration, `final static double PI = 3.14;`
                        2. in static block, `final static double PI; static { PI = 3.14}`
                    3. local
                        1. initialized when declaration , `final int a = 10`
                        2. declaration and then assigment, `final int a; a = 100;`
                    4. parameter: can only be assigned by arguments
    3.  inheritance
        1. property
            1. only support one superclass using `extends`
            2. a superclass refererce can refer to a subclass object
        2. constructor
            1. when both subclass and superclass defining no constructor, they use default constructors created automatically by Java
            2. when only the subclass defines a constructor, simply construct the subclass object
            3. when both the subclass and superclass define constructors, both of them should be executed, using `super`. **`super` must be the first statement executed inside a subclass constructor**
                1. `super()`: call superclass constructor
                2. `super.member`: call superclass member
        3. overriding method
            1. have same signature and compatible return type as a method in its superclass
9.  Interface
    1.  properties
        1. specify what must be done, but not how to do it, `access interface name {ret-type method-name (param-list) [throws AException]; type var1 = value1; ...}` 
        2. interface methods are implicitly `public`. methods that implement an interface must be declared `public`, because methods in interface are implicitly `public`
        3. variables declared in the interface are not instance variables, but implicitly `public`, `final` and `static` and must be initialized, so they are constants
        4. if a class includes an interface but does not fully implement the methods defined by that interface, then that class must be declared as `abstract`
        5. an interface cannot have instance variable, but declaring a reference variable of an interface type is allowed
        6. use `extends` for one interface to inheirt another interface
        7. since JDK8, it can provide a default implementation preceded by the keyword `default`, `default int getId() {return 1}`
        8. JDK8 also suports static method. They are not inherited by either an implementing class or a subinterface
        9. `IntefaceName.super().methodName` refers to a default implementation explicitly, that is use `methodName` in interface `InterfaceName`
10. Enumeration
    1. properties
        1. use `enum`, `enum Transport {CAR, TRUCK, BOAT}`
        2. the identifiers are enumeration constants, and implicitly declared as a `public`, `static` member. Their type is the type of enumeration, such as `Transport`, called *self-typed*
        3. an enum can not be instantiated by `new`
        4. can define constructor, instance variables and methods
        5. can not inherit another class, but itself inheirt from abstract class `Enum`
        6. cannot be a superclass
    2. methods
        1. static
            1. `.values()`
            2. `.valueOf(String str)`
        2. instance
            1. `.ordinal()`
            2. `.compareTo()`
11. Annotation
    1. properties
        1. embed supplemental information into a source file called an *annotation*, which does not change the actions of a program
        2. an annotation cannot include an `extends` clause, but all annotation types automatically extend `Annotation` interface in `java.lang.annotation` package. use `@interface AnnoName {String str(); int val() default 900; ...}`, consists solely of method declarations without bodies, much like fields. Java will implement these methods
        3. methods in the annotation must be without parameters, the return type must be one of the following:
            1. a primitive type
            2. an object of type `String` or `Class`
            3. an `enum` type
            4. another annotation type
            5. an array of one of the preceding types
        4. when a annotation member is given a value, only its name is used, look like fields in this context, `@AnnoName(str="Example", val=100)`
        5. an annotation specified `RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME`, can be queried during run time using `reflection`. the reflection enables information about a class to be obtained at run time
    2. type
        1. marker annotation: have no members, just to make an item with some attribute
        2. single-member annotation: have one member, no need to specify member name, just support value when the member name is `value`
    3. sources
        1. `java.lang.annotation`
            1. `@Documented`
            2. `@Inherited`
            3. `@Retention`: used only as an annotation to another annotation
                1. `RetentionPolicy.SOURCE`: retained only in the source file, and discarded during compilation
                2. `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`: default, stored in the `.class` file during compilation, not available through JVM during run time
                3. `RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME`: stored in the `.class` file during compilation and available through JVM during run time, offer greatest annotation persistence
            4. `@Taget`: support one or more values `@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE})`
                1. `ElementType`
                    1. `CONSTRUCTOR`
                    2. `FIELD`
                    3. `LOCAL_VARIABLE`
                    4. `METHOD`
                    5. `PARAMETER`
                    6. `PACKAGE`
                    7. `TYPE`: class, interface (including annotation type), or enum declaration
                    8. `ANNOTATION_TYPE`
            5. `@Repeatable` 
            6. `@Native`
        2. `java.lang`
            1. `@Override`
            2. `@Deprecated`
            3. `@SafeVarargs`
            4. `@FunctionalInterface`
            5. `@SuppressWarnings`
12. Generics: reuse code safely and reliadbly
    1. For
        1. classes: `class A<T, V extends T> {}`
        2. interfaces: `interface A<T>`
        3. constructor: `<T extends Number> Summation(T arg) {}`
        4. methods: `T getOb(T others) {}`
        5. static methods: `static <T extends Comparable<T>, V extends T> boolean arraysEqual(T[] x, V[] y) `
    2. Properties
        1. work only with reference types, primitive type not allowed
        2. type member can't be instantiated, this is wrong `new T[]`
        3. no static member can use a type parameter declared by the enclosing class, but staticc generic methods are allowed, which define their own type parameters
        4. an array whose element type is a type parameter is not allowed instantiated, this is wrong `new T[]`
        5. an array of type-specific generic referces can not be created, this is wrong `new Gen<Integer>[10]`
        6. a generic class cannot extend `Throwable`, so can not create generic exception classes
    3. Type Member
        1. no bound: `<T>`
        2. upper bound: `<T extends A>`
        3. lower bound: `<T super A>`
        4. raw type: without type arguments, lose type safety, may cause run-time error. in essence, the type will be replaced by `Object`
    4. Wildcard Argument
        1. no bound: `<?>`
        2. upper bound: `<? extends A>`
        3. lower bound: `<? super A>`
13. Lambda Expression
    1. components
        1. `->`: lambda operator
        2. parameters
        3. body
            1. a single expression: `n -> (n % 2) == 0; (n) -> (n % 2) == 0`, `()` not needed for one parameter
            2. a block of code: code in `{}` containing `return`
    2. properties
        1. variable capture
            1. instance and static vairable defined in the enclosing scope of a lambda expression can be accessed and modified
            2. local variables defined in the enclosing scope of the lambda expresson can be used when they are *effectively final*, which cannot be changed after it is first assigned without explicity defined `final`
        2. throw an exception
            1. should throw a checked exception
            2. compatible with functional interface exceptions
        3. method references
            1. to a static method: `ClassName::methodName`, `::` is added by JDK8 for this purpose
            2. to a instance method: `objRef::methodName`
            3. to any object of a given class: `ClassName::instanceMethodName`, then the first parameter matches the invoking object, and others matches the method parameters
            4. to a generic method: can use, but not needed, e.g., `ClassName::<Integer>methodName`
        4. constructor references
            1. create references to constructors using `classname::new`, to a generic class `classname<Integer>::new`
            2. declare a constructor that creates an array using `type[]::new`, the interface that creates an array must containa method taking a single `int` parameter and returns a reference to the array of the specified size

                ```java
                interface MyClassArrayCreator {
                    MyClass[] func(int n);
                }

                MyClassArrayCreator mcArrayCons = MyClass[]::new;
                MyClass[] a = mcArrayCons.func(3);
                for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
                    a[i] = new MyClass(i)
                
                // generic
                interface MyArrayCreator<T> {
                    T[] func(int n);
                }

                MyArrayCreator<Thread> mcArrayCons = Thread[]::new;
                Thread[] thrds = mcArrayCons.func(5)
                ```
    3. kinds for target type context
        1. variable initialization
        2. assignment
        3. argument passing
        4. others including casts, `?` operator, array initializers, `return`statements and lambda expressions
    4.  functional interface: contains one and only one abstract method, support generic type
14. Package
    1. define: `package a.b`
    2. find: through `CLASSPATH` or `-cp, -classpath`
    3. import
        1. `import a.b.c`
        2. `import a.b.*`
        3. `import static java.lang.Math.sqrt`: import static method `sqrt` in `Math`
        4. `import static java.lang.Math.*`: import all static methods in class `Math`
    4. standard 
        1. `java.lang`: import automatically into evary java program
        2. `java.io`: I/O classes
        3. `java.net`: for networking
15. Exception
    1. Catch or Specify Requirement: code that might throw exceptions must be enclosed by either of the following, otherwise the code will not be compiled
        1. A `try` statement that catches the excpetion. The `try` must privide a handle for the exception
        2. A method specifies it can throw the exception. The method must provide a `throws` clause listing the exception
    2. Types
        1. Checked Exception
            1. Exception
                1. Should anticipate and recover from
                2. All exceptions are checked exceptions, except for `Error` and `RuntimeException` and their subclasses
                3. **Subject to the Catch or Specify Requirement**
                4. A well-written program will catch this exception and notify the mistake
        2. Unchecked Exceptions
            1. Error
                1. External to the application which usually cannot anticipate or recover from, which always occurs in the JVM
                2. Indicated by `Error` and its subclasses
                3. **Not subject to the Catch or Specify Requirement**
                4. Might catch this exception in order to notify the problem, but makes sense to print a stack trace and exit
            2. RuntimeException
                1. Internal to the application that cannot anticipate or recover from, indicating bugs such as logic error or improper use of API in the during run time
                2. Indicated by `RuntimeException` and its subclasses
                3. **Not subject to the Catch or Specify Requirement**
                4. Can catch this exception, but it probably makes more sense to eliminate the bug that caused the excption
                5. subclass
                    1. `NullPointerException`
                    2. `IndexOutOfBoundsException`
                    3. `ArithmeticException`
                    4. `IllegalArgumentException`
                    5. `ClassCastException`
        3. Throwable
            1. `.printStackTrace()`
            2. `.toString()`
    3. Exception Handlers
        1. try-catch-finally
            1. `try`: work with at least one of `catch` or `finally`
            2. `catch`
                1. a single handler with one exception

                    ```java
                    try {
                        ...
                    }
                    catch (Exception e) {
                        ...
                    }
                    ```
                2. a single handler with multiple type exceptions
                    1. the `catch` parameter is implicitly `final`, so it cannot be assigned any other value within the catch block
                    2. since Java SE7

                    ```java
                    try {
                        ...
                    }
                    catch (Exception1|Exception2 e) {
                        ...
                    }
                    ```
                3. multiple handlers

                    ```java
                    try {
                        ...
                    }
                    catch (Exception1 e1) {
                        ...
                    }
                    catch (Exception2 e2) {
                        ...
                    }
                    catch (Exception1|Exception2 e) {
                        ...
                    }
                    ```
            3. `finally`: always execute when the try block exits, even when `try` or `catch` statements return from the method
                1.  if the JVM exits while the `try` or `catch` code is being executed, then the `finally` block may not execute
                2.  if the thread executing the `try` or `catch` code is interrupted or killed, the `finally` block may not execute even though the applicanas a whole continues
        2. try-with-resources
            1. since Jave SE7, a *resource* is an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it, and it is `final` implicitly, scoped to try-with-resources statement
            2. any object that implements `java.lang.AutoCloseable`, including all objects which implement `java.io.Closeable`, can be used as a resource. `Closeable` interface extends the `AutoCloseable` interface
                1.  the `close` method of the `AutoCloseable` interface throws exceptions of type `Exception`
                2.  the `close` method of the `Closeable` interface throws exceptions of type `IOException`
            3. multiple resources can be separated by a semicolon `;`. `close` methods of resources are called in the opposite order of their creation
            4. a try-with-resources statement can have `catch` and `finally` blocks just like an ordinary `try` statement. in a try-with-resources statement, `catch` or `finally` block is run after the resources declared have been closed
            5. **if an exception is thrown from `try` block and one or more exceptions are thrown from the try-with-resources statement, then those exceptions thrown from the try-with-resources statement are suppressed, and the exception thrown by the block is the one that is thrown. the suppressed exceptions can be retrieve by calling `Throwable.getSuppressed()` from the exception thrown by the `try` block, `Throwabel[] th = e.getSuppressed()`**
        3. Method Throws Exceptions: not catch the exception, but allow further up the call stack to handle it

            ```java
            public void writeList() throws IOException, OtherException, ... { ...}
            ```
        4. Throw statement: `throw new IOException()`
16. IO
    1. byte stream
        1. `InputStream`
            1. `BufferedInputStream`
            2. `ByteArrayInputStream`
            3. `FileInputStream`
            4. `DataInputStream`
            5. `java.util.Scanner()`
                1. `hasNextInt()`
                2. `hasNextDouble()`
                3. `nextInt()`
                4. `nextDouble()`
        2. `OutputStream`
            1. `BufferedOutputStream`
            2. `ByteArrayOutputStream`
            3. `FileOutputStream`
            4. `DataOutputStream`
            5. `PrintStream`
    2. character stream

            1. `BufferedReader`
                1. `.readLine()`
            2. `InputStreamReader`
            3. `CharArrayReader`
            4. `StringReader`
            5. `FileReader`
        2. `Writer`
            1. `BufferedWriter`
            2. `OutputStreamWriter`
            3. `CharArrayWriter`
            4. `StringWriter`
            5. `FileWriter`

        2. all objects in Java have a monitor built into the Java language itself, so all objects can be synchronized
        3. using `synchronized` to support synchroization
            1. synchronized method: `synchronized int sum(int[] nums) {}`
            2. synchronized block: `synchronized(objref) {}`

        1. `wait()`
        2. `notify()`
        3. `notifyAll()`: notify all threads, with the highest priority thread gaining access to the object
    2. properties
