Don't wait until everything is just right. It will never be perfect. There will always be challenges, obstacles and less than perfect conditions. So what. Get started now. With each step you take, you will grow stronger and stronger, more and more skilled, more and more self-confident, and more and more successful.

不要等到万事俱备，没有那么完美的事儿。总是会有挑战，障碍，和不够完美的条件。那又怎样。现在就开始行动。每走一步，你会越来越强，越来越熟练，越来越自信，越来越成功。
