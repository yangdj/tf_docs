2. About
    1. Capabilities
        1. to **publish** (write) and **subscribe** to (read) streams of events
        2. to **store** streams of events durably and reliably for as long as you want
        3. to **process** streams of events as they occur or retrospectively
    2. Functions
        1. distributed
        2. high scalable
        3. high available
        4. fault-tolerant
        5. secure manner
3. Concepts
    1. Architect
        1. Servers
            1. Broker: storage layer
            2. Connector: import and export data as event streams to integrate Kafka with existing systems
        2. Clients: talk to Kafka servers
    2. Event: also called record or message, record data happened
        1. Structure
            1. events organized and durably stored in *topics*, similar to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are the files in that folder
            2. topics are **partitioned**
                1. a topic is spread over a number of buckets located on different brokers.
                2. new event published to a topic, is actually appended one of the topic's partition
                3. the same event key event are written to the same partition
                4. any consumer of a given topic-partition will always read that partition's events in exactly the same order as they were written
                5. every topic can be **replicated** at the level of topic partitions. a common production replication factor is 3
            3. events are not deleted after assumption, the retaining time can be defined through a per-topic configuraiton setting
        2. Contents
            1. key
            2. value
            3. timestamp
            4. headers: optional
