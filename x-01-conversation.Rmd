## Acne Treatment 

A: Why do you have a **Band-Aid** (创口贴, 绷带, OK绷) on your face?

B: It's not a Band-Aid, it's an **acne patch** (痘痘贴). I have a big **pimple** (青春痘) here, and I'm hoping the patch will make it go away faster.

A: Oh. I haven't had acne problems since high school. In high school, I had really bad acne.

B: What did you do about it?

A: I bought **over-the-counter** (非处方药) medicine at the pharmacy. When that didn't work, I saw a dermatologist (皮肤科医生) regularly and took prescription drugs (处方药).

B: Did it help?

A: It helped some, but my acne only completely cleared after high school. Then I had to get laser treatment to get rid of the acne scars (伤疤).

B: Thanks for sharing. I won't complain about a single pimple then!
