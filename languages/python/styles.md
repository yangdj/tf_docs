# python styles

## coding

* code is indented by 4 spaces without using tabs.
* classes use a singular noun, and follow the *CamelCase* convention.
* functions and methods use lowercase letters, and separated by underscores.
* names e.g., parameters, instance variable, or local variable should be a lowercase noun.
* costant variables are all capitalized.
* identifiers with a single leading underscore (e.g., `_secret`) are for internal use.

## documentation

any string appears as the first statement within the body of a module, class, or function will be considered to be a docstring, and should be delimited within triple quotes `"""`.

more detailed docstrings should begin with a single line that summarizes the purpose, followed by a blank line, and then further details.
