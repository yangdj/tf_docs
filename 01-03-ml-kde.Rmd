# KDE

KDE (Kernel Density Estimator) uses a kernel to estimate distribution of a sample:

$$
\hat p_n(x) = \frac {1}{nh}\sum_{i=1}^{n}K(\frac{X_i - x}{h})
$$

\(K(x)\) is called kernel function, \(h\) is called bandwidth. \(K(x)\) has properties:

$$
K(x) = K(-x) \\
\max_x K(x) = K(0) \\
\int{K(x)}\mathrm{d}x=1 \\
\lim_{x \to \infty}K(x) = 0
$$

The following kernels are often used.

: (\#tab:kernels) Kernel Functions

| Name         | \(K(x)\)                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Gaussian     | \(\frac{1}{\sqrt {2\pi}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}\) |
| Uniform      | \(\frac {1}{2}I(-1 \le x \le 1)\)            |
| Epanechnikov | \(\frac {3}{4}\max\{1-x^2, 0\}\)             |

Epanechnikov is a special kernel that has the lowest (asymptotic) mean square error.
