# ssh

## usage

for ssh login using public key authentication, first generate keys:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

then copy generated public key to the remote server:

```bash
ssh-copy-id host
```

when log in a new server, you may need to verity the remote server. first, gather public (ecdsa) key of the new server, the value is the same as in the file `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub` of the new server

```bash
ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa ip-or-hostname > server_ecdsa
```

then, find out the fingerprint of the new server public key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -l -f server_ecdsa
```

using this result to compare to the fingerprint returned by the new server

you can also compute the fingerprint of the **host** stored in the file `known_hosts`:

```bash
ssh-keygen -l -F host-in-known-hosts
```
